These are just random Ruby programs that I wrote to 
learn something new, or snippets of code that I 
use often and want to reference so I don't have to
keep writing the same code over and over.

- geolocate.rb  \t Look up longitude and latitude from an address. Uses Google Geolocate API

- menu_method.rb \t Create a simple menu and while loop through it

- open_file.rb  \t Open a file and output it's contents
