These are just random Ruby programs that I wrote to 
learn something new, or snippets of code that I 
use often and want to reference so I don't have to
keep writing the same code over and over.

- **geolocate.rb**   Look up longitude and latitude from an address. Uses Google Geolocate API

- **menu_method.rb**  Create a simple menu and while loop through it

- **open_file.rb**   Open a file and output it's contents

- **read_write_file_modes.rb** Ruby File Open Modes:

- **class_getters_setters.rb** Creating Class Getters and Setters

- **classes_attr_accessor.rb** Automatically write your Getter and Setter and instance variables on the fly...

- **classes.rb** Intro Into Classes
